<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<p><i>the ringing of chaotic pitches and metallic dishes</I></p>

<p>Experimented with the input-effects-output starter file and the chaotic (polynomial recurrence) number generator to create shifting pitches that behaved somewhat randomly but with a noticeable up-down pattern, and with measured left-right shifting. The intent was to make 'ringing' type sounds with a metallic object and have the program supplement these by responding with volume changes and its own ringing patterns.</p>

<p>The piece is broken up into three 15-second snippets, each having its own experiment-based numerical values and seed values for the chaotic number generator. Here's a link to my ChucK code for this project:</p>
